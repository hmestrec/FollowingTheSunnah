        <p>Keeping a beard is a significant tradition in Islam, associated with the practice of following the Sunnah, which refers to the customs and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The beard symbolizes a commitment to faith and is an external manifestation of a Muslimâ€™s inner dedication to their beliefs.</p>
        <p>Many Muslims believe that keeping the beard is part of the Fitrah, or natural disposition, which includes grooming practices that align with Islamic teachings.</p>
