        <p>For us to experience and contain the morning's blessings, we must prioritize our early sleep the night before to not miss the early morning blessings.
            After Isha, there is no need to stay up unless a deadline is to be met before the night ends. We must also try to finish what we need to finish before the evening so that we can sleep with a rested mind at ease as if we are returning to Allah. When one reflects, why sleep late when the best of ibadah and blessing are in the morning? Wouldn’t you rather prefer this time over any other? When you conduct this pattern of waking up early and sleeping early you’ll reach a habit of finishing everything before the evening and notice the change. Remember you have the control.</p>
        <p>We need to reevaluate our priorities in life and schedule around it. Just as you see we take our dunya things over our Deen fearful of maybe missing a deadline or a consequence we must prioritize our Deen over our worldly things and even more than we do for the dunya and think about our deadlines with Allah and the consequences we may receive.
            A Muslim must rise early for him to do so he must sleep early for the body to function properly and worship Allah the best.</p>
        <p>Let’s keep taking action. Let’s not become too content until we reach a routine. We must do this every day as if it’s our last day. For us to do so we must start making habits and be disciplined to reach this routine. </p>
        <p>Mindset: Go to sleep early just as you prioritize to stay up for your worldly affairs. All you need to do is switch your priorities not just in the mind but through action. You see exactly how people chase this world and will leave everything behind including sleep just to receive it. Now take that same thrive/priority but do it for your Deen. Now we must see the difference in one striving for the world and for Deen, we must be striving more for our Deen than the people that strive for the world. Now do this all for the sake of Allah.</p>
